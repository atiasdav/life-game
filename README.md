# life-game

this is a GUI aplication of Conway's Game of Life

the rules of the game are:

    1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
    2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
    3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
